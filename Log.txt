# I'm going to use this as a temporary way to store my logs for research.

# Day 1

I'm going to be honest, I have a lot of machine learning background in mathematics, but this is quite limited as I am unable to apply my learnings. So welcome to my project run through where I walk myself through learning how to apply my theories into an actual project in hopes that I can get into the AISF program as a fourth year. All prior experience I have is limited to Math 156, CS 161, and CS M148, but I do know that reinforcement learning is a learning method where an agent has a model of "good" vs "bad" signals that come from an action it takes. In regards to coding, I've taken a number of CS courses here and dabbled a bit into codeforces and leetcode. Anyways, that's the first few minutes of what I spent on this project and I'm going to dive into reading the script.

First hour spent, 
Reading through the application, learning what RL really is and how to do it myself, and asking gemini 3 how I can achieve a high level understanding of the following concepts (basic reward crafting, hand tuning parameters, exploration vs exploitation, observation normalization, advantage vs reward, action clipping, etc)

The idea is to first try and run the heuristic training on my own without prior knowledge despite having a couple of research papers that were recommended that I read. 

Trying out the heuristic myself. 


Ablation studies to understand how much better the rewards/ other metrics is based on your improvements over your baseline
Hyperparameter tuning
Graphs from training



Writeup
Should be around 3 pages, including references, not a strict max or min though.

Here is what we want listed:
Your name and email
Any prior experience you have in RL, Deep learning, and coding
The number of hours spent and a break down of how you spent them
Compute resources (can mostly be done on CPU so mention the number of logical threads and the model)
If you want GPUs, use Colab (though note this will likely be slower than cpu)
If compute restrained, you can list detailed experiments you’d want to run in greater detail (though you should try to use google colab first). 
A video of your walker’s best performance (this should list the total number of time steps to train)
Techniques used
And the justification of why the techniques work here
Ablation studies
Discussion of issues encountered (we also want to see what ideas you thought were good, didn’t work out, and how you pivoted from them)
Conclusion of what worked well and what else could be done with more time
Citations for papers used
